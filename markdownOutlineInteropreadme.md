# Markdown as an outliner interop format

As I implement the file format used by LogSeq and Obsidian to interop, in Drummer, I'm taking notes here. If there is any documentation on this format, I don't know where it is. 

### Background and agenda

So I'm going to document the assumptions Drummer makes, and hope that the current implementors will participate in either validating the assumptions, or saying what the actual format is. 

This is not a place to debate which format is better, what formats to support is a choice for every developer to make for themselves.
