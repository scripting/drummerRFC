# drummerRFC

A place to post RFCs for people who use and develop in <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a>. 

### About RFCs

RFC stands for Request For Comment.

The concept goes back to the original development of the Internet.

At UserLand, RFCs were a way for us to communicate with each other on projects that required thought and buy-in from others on the team. It's a way to have your ideas reviewed before they get locked down. 

### What is an RFC?

An RFC is a short informal document with your ideas on a topic for a new development project which you want feedback or buy-in on. 

### Why Drummer RFCs?

We've been really fortunate in the first couple of weeks of Drummer's public availability, and have attracted a nice group of technical users who are exploring all the nooks and crannies of Drummer and posting their observations in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues">support forum</a> for Drummer users. I am a real hardass about not allowing it to drift in this direction for a lot of reasons, but most importantly -- users get intimidated by deeply technical talk, and tech people often take advantage of that. So what happens is we lose the ability to support users. 

I also have a problem with it, because when people discuss features they want in Drummer, they're basically trying to manage me. Not cool. You wouldn't like it either. That was the source of the angst on the RSS mail lists, for example, or on the Frontier community mail lists. The work other people do is not decided democratically, unless they work for you. There's no slavery on the internet, at least we hope not! :-)

Anyway -- there have been a number of interesting questions raised that I've had to shut down. But the people are smart and the ideas are worth discussing. And as long as people stay respectful of each other, this is an idea worth trying out. 

So if you have something you'd like to discuss, or have a project you'd like to work on with others, open an issue here, and let's see how it goes. If it turns into a disaster, I reserve the right to put it out of its misery. ;-)

### Format and evolution

Since we all have blogs, I suggest writing the detailed version of your RFC on your blog and post a pointer to it in the group. But that's not a requirement. If you're more comfortable writing in the GitHub editor, go for it.

I was tempted to wait to do this until we had the feature built in the Drummer environment, but let's start here and keep an open mind to using the outliner and other servers. For now, we all know how to use GitHub issues, so we'll use that. 

### It's recursive

The RFC forum is kind of an RFC on the idea of an RFC forum. :smile:
